Aileron/rudder/elevator/throttle mixer for PX4FMU
==================================================

This file defines mixers suitable for controlling a fixed wing aircraft with
aileron, rudder, elevator and throttle controls using PX4FMU. The configuration
assumes the aileron servo(s) are connected to PX4FMU servo output 0, the
elevator to output 1, the rudder to output 2 and the throttle to output 3.

Inputs to the mixer come from channel group 0 (vehicle attitude), channels 0
(roll), 1 (pitch) and 3 (thrust).

Right Aileron mixer
-------------
Three scalers total (output, roll, flaps).

This mixer assumes that the aileron servos are set up correctly mechanically;
depending on the actual configuration it may be necessary to reverse the scaling
factors (to reverse the servo movement) and adjust the offset, scaling and
endpoints to suit.

S: 0 0  10000  10000      0 -10000  10000
S: 0 4  10000  10000      0 -10000  10000

Elevator mixer
------------
Two scalers total (output, roll).

This mixer assumes that the elevator servo is set up correctly mechanically;
depending on the actual configuration it may be necessary to reverse the scaling
factors (to reverse the servo movement) and adjust the offset, scaling and
endpoints to suit.

S: 0 1  -10000  -10000      0 -10000  10000

Rudder mixer
------------
Two scalers total (output, yaw).

This mixer assumes that the rudder servo is set up correctly mechanically;
depending on the actual configuration it may be necessary to reverse the scaling
factors (to reverse the servo movement) and adjust the offset, scaling and
endpoints to suit.

M: 1
O:      10000  10000      0 -10000  10000
S: 0 2  10000  10000      0 -10000  10000

Motor speed mixer
-----------------
Two scalers total (output, thrust).

This mixer generates a full-range output (-1 to 1) from an input in the (0 - 1)
range.  Inputs below zero are treated as zero.

M: 1
O:      10000  10000      0 -10000  10000
S: 0 3      0  20000 -10000 -10000  10000
